# AndroidMalwareDetection

Static Analysis:

Within the 'StaticAnalysis' folder there should be 3 files:
featureExtrac.py
app_classes.txt
app_permissions.txt

featureExtrac.py should always be run with python3.6 as this is the python
version used when developing the program

To run featureExtrac.py the program requires one argument which is the folder where
the benign and malware applications are held. The folder should have the following structure

|Dataset:
|---Malware
|---Benign

Where 'Malware' And 'Benign' are both folders which contain the malware and benign applications

Machine learning:

The code machine learning algorithms tested can be found in the 'Jupyter' folder
Anaconda software and the Jupyter notebook is needed in order to run each file.

to run each .ipynb folder there are a number of dependencies in order for the
notebooks to be able to run:

-sklearn
-tensorflow
-keras
-numpy
-pandas
-logitboost
-hyperopt
-hpsklearn
-tpot
-opytimizer
-kerastuner

In the second cell of each .ipynd file replace "DATASET PATH HERE" string with the
path to the csv which contains the vector spaces for each dataset.

The csv files containing the application vector spaces created by the featureExtrac.py can be found in 'StaticAnalysis/Feature_sets'.
